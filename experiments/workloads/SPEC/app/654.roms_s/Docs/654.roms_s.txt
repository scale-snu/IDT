                       SPEC CPU2017 Benchmark Description

  Benchmark Name

   654.roms_s

  Benchmark Author

   ROMS is written and maintained by "The ROMS/TOMS Group", which is
   described as:

     * ROMS: Regional Ocean Modeling System
     * TOMS: Terrain-following Ocean Modeling System

  Benchmark Program General Category

   ROMS is a Regional Ocean Modeling System

  Benchmark Description

   ROMS is a free-surface, hydrostatic, primitive equation model discretized
   with a terrain-following vertical coordinate system. It is coded in
   parallel for multi-threaded and multi-process architectures and has been
   widely applied in many applications from planetary scales down to the
   scales of estuarine environments. Forecasts include predictions of water
   temperature, ocean currents, salinity, and sea surface height.

   554.ROMS is based on ROMS/TOMS version 3.2 SVN Revision: 405M except some
   code from ROMS (573) to solve a race condition.

   ROMS usually requires NETCDF, but the BENCHMARK dataset used will make no
   calls to NETCDF so the port to SPEC includes a few NETCDF constants being
   defined but does NOT require the NETCDF code to be present.

  Input Description

   654.roms_s uses the generic BENCHMARK data set.
   TITLE = Benchmark Test, Idealized Southern Ocean, Small Grid

   The files used are:

   varinfo.dat                   Used by all tests

   ocean_benchmarkN.in.x  where N=[0123] representing test, train,
                                 refrate, and refspeed.

   The ocean_benchmarkN.in.x files are read from stdin. They are preprocessed
   for the OpenMP threaded version to find an optimal and legal set of values
   for tiling of the I and J dimensions, resulting in files
   ocean_benchmarkN.in

   To create larger or smaller datasets the following parameters in the
   ocean_benchmarkN.in.x files can be used for this (values shown for test
   case):

           Lm == 512           ! Number of I-direction INTERIOR RHO-points
           Mm == 64            ! Number of J-direction INTERIOR RHO-points
            N == 30            ! Number of vertical levels
       NTIMES == 5             ! Total number time-steps in current run.

   The 3 first parameters will impact both size (memory) and time spent, the
   last one only time.

   The SPEC-supplied test and train workloads use the Lm, Mm, and N values
   shown above; they differ only in NTIMES (total number of time steps), with
   5 steps done by test and 200 by train. Both use on the order of 270 MiB of
   memory on a Linux system tested by SPEC.

   For the refrate workload (which is used by the rate version), these values
   are used, and memory increases to about 850 MiB on the same Linux system:

             Lm == 1024          ! Number of I-direction INTERIOR RHO-points
             Mm == 128           ! Number of J-direction INTERIOR RHO-points
              N == 24            ! Number of vertical levels
         NTIMES == 150           ! Total number time-steps in current run.

   The refspeed workload (for the speed version of the benchmark) uses about
   13.7 GiB on the tested system, and has these values:

             Lm == 2048          ! Number of I-direction INTERIOR RHO-points
             Mm == 512           ! Number of J-direction INTERIOR RHO-points
              N == 40            ! Number of vertical levels
         NTIMES == 100           ! Total number time-steps in current run.

  Output Description

   After each time step, various calculated energies and volume are printed
   and validated against a SPEC-supplied set of expected answers. Note that
   all of the values printed in the table after each step are calculated. The
   fact that 3 of the 4 values printed are the same on each step is an
   expected behavior.

   The output is written to stdout, which is redirected to:
   ocean_benchmarkN.log where N is again 0, 1, 2, or 3.
