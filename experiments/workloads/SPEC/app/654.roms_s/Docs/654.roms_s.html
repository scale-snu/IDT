SPEC CPU2017 Benchmark Description</h1>
</div>
 
<h3>Benchmark Name</h3>
<p>654.roms_s</p>

<h3>Benchmark Author</h3>
<p>ROMS is written and maintained 
by "The ROMS/TOMS Group", which is described as:</p> 
<ul>
   <li>ROMS: Regional Ocean Modeling System</li>
   <li>TOMS: Terrain-following Ocean Modeling System</li>
</ul>

<h3>Benchmark Program General Category</h3>
<p>ROMS is a Regional Ocean Modeling System</p>
 
<h3>Benchmark Description</h3>
<p>ROMS is a free-surface, hydrostatic, primitive equation model discretized
with a terrain-following vertical coordinate system.  It is coded in parallel
for multi-threaded and multi-process architectures and has been widely applied
in many applications from planetary scales down to the scales of estuarine
environments. Forecasts include predictions of water temperature, ocean
currents, salinity, and sea surface height.</p>

<p>554.ROMS is based on ROMS/TOMS version 3.2    SVN Revision: 405M
except some code from ROMS (573) to solve a race condition.</p>
<p>ROMS usually requires NETCDF, but the <b>BENCHMARK</b> dataset used will make
no calls to NETCDF so the port to SPEC includes a few NETCDF constants being
defined but does NOT require the NETCDF code to be present.</p>

<h3>Input Description</h3>
<p>654.roms_s uses the generic <b>BENCHMARK</b> data set.   <br />
TITLE = Benchmark Test, Idealized Southern Ocean, Small Grid</p>
<p>The files used are:</p>
<pre>
  varinfo.dat                   Used by all tests<br />
  ocean_benchmark<b>N</b>.in.x  where <b>N</b>=[0123] representing test, train, 
                                refrate, and refspeed.  
</pre>

<p>The ocean_benchmark<b>N</b>.in.x files are read from stdin.  They are
preprocessed for the OpenMP threaded version to find an optimal and legal set of
values for tiling of the I and J dimensions, resulting in files
ocean_benchmark<b>N</b>.in</p>

<p>To create larger or smaller datasets the following parameters in the
ocean_benchmark<b>N</b>.in.x files can be used for this (values shown for test
case):</p>
<pre>
	  Lm == 512           ! Number of I-direction INTERIOR RHO-points
          Mm == 64            ! Number of J-direction INTERIOR RHO-points
           N == 30            ! Number of vertical levels
      NTIMES == 5             ! Total number time-steps in current run.
</pre>
<p>The 3 first parameters will impact both size (memory) and time spent, the last one only time.</p>

<p>The SPEC-supplied <tt>test</tt> and <tt>train</tt> workloads use the Lm, Mm,
and N  values shown above; they differ only in NTIMES (total number of time
steps), with 5 steps done by test and 200 by train. Both use on the order of 270&nbsp;MiB 
of memory on a Linux system tested by SPEC.</p>

<p>For the <tt>refrate</tt> workload (which is used by the rate version), these values
are used, and memory increases to about 850&nbsp;MiB on the same Linux system:</p>
<pre>
            Lm == 1024          ! Number of I-direction INTERIOR RHO-points
            Mm == 128           ! Number of J-direction INTERIOR RHO-points
             N == 24            ! Number of vertical levels
        NTIMES == 150           ! Total number time-steps in current run.
</pre>

<p>The <tt>refspeed</tt> workload (for the speed version of the benchmark) uses 
about 13.7&nbsp;GiB on the tested system, and has these values:</p>
<pre>
            Lm == 2048          ! Number of I-direction INTERIOR RHO-points
            Mm == 512           ! Number of J-direction INTERIOR RHO-points
             N == 40            ! Number of vertical levels
        NTIMES == 100           ! Total number time-steps in current run.
</pre>




<h3>Output Description</h3>

<p>After each time step, various calculated energies and volume are printed and
validated against a SPEC-supplied set of expected answers.  Note that all of
the values printed in the table after each step are calculated.  The fact that
3 of the 4 values printed are the same on each step is an expected behavior.
</p>

<p>The output is written to stdout, which is redirected to: <br />
ocean_benchmark<b>N</b>.log where <b>N</b> is again 0, 1, 2, or 3.</p>


<h3>Programming Language</h3>
<p>Fortran 2003</p>

<h3>Threading Model</h3>
<p>OpenMP only</p>

<h3>Known portability issues</h3>
<p>None</p>
