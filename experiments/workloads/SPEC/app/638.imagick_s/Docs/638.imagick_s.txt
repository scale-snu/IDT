  Benchmark Program General Category

   Image Manipulation.

  Benchmark Description

   ImageMagick is a software suite to create, edit, compose, or convert
   bitmap images. The SPEC CPU2017 benchmark version uses the convert
   component of ImageMagick to perform various transforms on input images.

  Input Description

   Inputs to the benchmark are an image and a list of operations to perform
   on that image. The image output from the convert step is used as input to
   an image comparison program that calculates structural similarity (SSIM)
   values relative to a "reference" output image.

  Reference Inputs

   Both the rate mode reference workload (refrate) and the speed mode
   reference workload (refspeed) operate on a 2068x1380 pixel uncompressed
   24-bit TARGA format image cropped from a photo.

   The refrate workload performs the following operations in the following
   order on the input image:

    1. [1]-edge 41 (edge detection)
    2. [2]-resample 181% (increase image size to 3469x5199)
    3. [3]-emboss 31 (highlighting detected edges)
    4. [4]-colorspace YUV (conversion to YUV color space)
    5. [5]-mean-shift 19x19+15% (perturbation of the colors in the image)

   Output from this step is a 3469x5199 24-bit TARGA image.

   The refspeed workload performs the following operations in the following
   order on the input image:

    1. [6]-resize 817% (increase image size to 11275x16896)
    2. [7]-rotate -2.76 (deskew the image)
    3. [8]-shave 540x375 (crop to middle 10195x16146 of image)
    4. [9]-alpha remove (discard internal alpha channel data)
    5. [10]-auto-level (normalize colors)
    6. [11]-contrast-stretch 1x1% (increase contrast)
    7. [12]-colorspace Lab [13]-channel R [14]-equalize +channel [15]+channel
       (equalize contrast in Lab color space)
    8. [16]-colorspace sRGB (convert to sRGB colorspace)
    9. [17]-define histogram:unique-colors=false (speed up histogram-based
       operations)
   10. [18]-adaptive-blur 0x5 (smooth the image)
   11. [19]-despeckle (remove speckles left after smoothing)
   12. [20]-auto-gamma (adjust the image gamma so that the mean color is at
       50% intensity)
   13. [21]-adaptive-sharpen 55 (sharpen the image)
   14. [22]-enhance (filter noise from image)
   15. [23]-brightness-contrast 10x10 (adjust brightness and contrast by
       around 10%)
   16. [24]-resize 30% (shrink the image to 3299x5002 for output)

   Output from this step is a 3299x5002 24-bit TARGA image.

  Training Inputs

   The input image for the feedback training workload (train) is a 10x10
   pixel uncompressed 24-bit TARGA format image of a blue dot.

   The train workload performs the following operations in the following
   order on the input image:

    1. [25]-resize 320x240
    2. [26]-shear 31 (shear the image horizontally by 31 degrees)
    3. [27]-edge 140 (edge detection)
    4. [28]-negate (replace each color with its complement)
    5. [29]-flop (mirror the image)
    6. [30]-resize 900x900
    7. [31]-edge 10 (edge detection)

   Output from this step is a 900x900 24-bit TARGA image.

  Test Inputs

   The input image for the test workload is a 10x10 pixel uncompressed 24-bit
   TARGA format image of a blue dot.

   The test workload performs the following operations in the following order
   on the input image:

    1. [32]-shear 25 (shear the image horizontally by 25 degrees)
    2. [33]-resize 640x480
    3. [34]-negate (replace each color with its complement)
    4. [35]-alpha Off (disable alpha channel)

   Output from this step is a 640x480 24-bit TARGA image.

  Output Description

   The output is compared using the SPEC utility [36]imagevalidate, which
   calculates the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index over 8x8 pixel areas
   between the benchmark-produced image and a SPEC-provided expected image.
   SSIM indexes range from -1 (maximally different) to 1 (identical) for each
   of those regions.

   If the images are too different, the image comparison program will issue
   an error. This is accomplished by specifying a threshold SSIM value, and
   if more than 0.1% of samples go below the threshold, the comparison is
   stopped and the benchmark does not pass validation. For test, train, and
   refrate the threshold SSIM value is 0.95; for refspeed it is 0.90. The
   refspeed threshold is lower because the image it operates on is much
   larger and individual differences, even when quite extreme, are very
   difficult to actually see.

   In all cases, the expected output from imagevalidate is

   <filename>: AVG SSIM = 1.000000000


   which is then checked by [37]specdiff to verify that the overall average
   of SSIM values is at least 0.99.

  Programming Language

   ANSI C

  Known portability issues

   None.
