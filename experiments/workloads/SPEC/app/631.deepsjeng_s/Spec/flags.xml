   whether they are portability candidates, mandatory, or forbidden.</p>

<flag name="DBIG_MEMORY" class="mandatory">
<![CDATA[
<p>The speed version of deepsjeng is compiled with BIG_MEMORY, and uses around 10x as much memory as the rate version.
   Having more memory allows more information to be stored about every position, notably if there are threats, or if
   there is only one good move. This information then causes some positions to be investigated deeper, which means it
   will take longer to reach the same search depth, but the result will be more accurate.</p>

<p>BIG_MEMORY is required when building the speed version of deepsjeng.  It is set by object.pm, and must not be set in the
   user config file.</p>
]]>

</flag>

<flag name="DSMALL_MEMORY" class="mandatory">
<![CDATA[
   <p>SMALL_MEMORY causes allocation of around 700 MiB of memory.  Compare to BIG_MEMORY.  </p>
   <p>The SMALL_MEMORY flag
      is required when building the rate version of deepsjeng.  It is set by object.pm, and must not be set on the user config file.</p>
]]>
</flag>

<flag name="DWIN32" class="forbidden">
Do not set WIN32; use SPEC_WINDOWS instead (automatically supplied when compiling under 'runcpu')
</flag>

<flag name="DWIN64" class="forbidden">
Do not set WIN64; use SPEC_WINDOWS instead (automatically supplied when compiling under 'runcpu')
</flag>

<flag name="D_MSC_VER" class="forbidden">
_MSC_VER disables some warnings.  It is set by the compiler, and you should not set it from the command line. 
</flag>


<flag name="DCOPYPROTECTION" class="forbidden">
COPYPROTECTION causes information to be printed about move timing.  It is not used in the SPEC version of deepsjeng.
</flag>


<flag name="DEVAL_DEBUG" class="forbidden">
EVAL_DEBUG may be useful during a debug effort.  It is not allowed for reportable runs.
</flag>


<flag name="DPAWN_EVAL_DEBUG" class="forbidden">
PAWN_EVAL_DEBUG may be useful during a debug effort.  It is not allowed for reportable runs.
