<h3>Benchmark Name</h3>

<p>631.deepsjeng_s</p>


<h3>Benchmark Authors</h3>

<p>Gian-Carlo Pascutto &lt;gcp &#x5b;at&#x5d; sjeng.org&gt;
</p>


<h3>Benchmark Program General Category</h3>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (alpha-beta tree search &amp; pattern
recognition)</p>


<h3>Benchmark Description</h3>

<p>631.deepsjeng_s is based on Deep Sjeng WC2008, the 2008 World Computer Speed-Chess Champion.
Deep Sjeng is a rewrite of the older Sjeng-Free program, focused on obtaining
the highest possible playing strength.</p>

<p>It attempts to find the best move via a combination of alpha-beta tree
searching, advanced move ordering, ositional evaluation and heuristic forward 
pruning. Practically, it will explore the tree of variations resulting from a 
given position to a given base depth, extending interesting variations
but discarding doubtful or irrelevant ones. From this tree the
optimal line of play for both players ("principal variation") is
determined, as well as a score reflecting the balance of power
between the two.</p>

<p>
Specific advances since the previous version include the use of bitboards
based on Kindergarten/Magic attack calculators, an evaluation function
with much deeper positional understanding, and a search function that is
significantly better at discarding irrelevant subtrees. The overall program
structure has been optimized for speed as well, dropping support for everything
besides classical chess.
</p>

<p>The rate version of the benchmark is compiled with <tt>SMALL_MEMORY</tt>.
It was observed to require around 700 MiB of memory during pre-release testing
on one of SPEC's Linux systems.  </p>

<p>The speed version is compiled with <tt>BIG_MEMORY</tt>, and uses around 10x
as much memory as the rate version.  Having more memory allows more
information to be stored about every position, notably if there are threats,
or if there is only one good move. This information then causes some positions
to be investigated deeper, which means it will take longer to reach the same
search depth, but the result will be more accurate.</p>


<h3>Input Description</h3>

<p>Both the rate and speed versions use the same inputs, a textfile containing
alternations of:</p>

<ol>
<li>a chess position in the standard Forsyth-Edwards Notation
(FEN) with optional Extended Position Description (EPD) tags, and
</li>

<li>the depth to which this position should be analyzed, in
half-moves (ply depth).</li>
</ol>


<h3>Output Description</h3>

<p>The output consists, per position, of some side information (textual
display of the chessboard, phase of the game, used parameters...) followed by
the output from the tree searching module as it progresses. This is formatted
as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Attained depth in half-moves (plies)</li>

<li>Score for the player that is to move, in equivalents of 1/100ths
pawn</li>

<li>Number of positions investigated</li>

<li>The optimal line of play ("principle variation").</li>
</ol>

<p>The output is validated against a SPEC-supplied set of expected outputs.
Note that the expected output differs between the rate and speed versions.</p>


<h3>Programming Language</h3>

<p>C++</p>


<h3>Known portability issues</h3>
